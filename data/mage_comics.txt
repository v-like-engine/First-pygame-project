Everything seemed like in a fairy tale

A peaceful nation lived under the leadership of their kind king.

The fantasy and the humanity existed in a harmony.

But there also were some who did not like such state of affairs.

The revolutionaries.
They started a riot against the government. Against the magic...

All dragons were murdered, all witches were burnt in the flames.
Wizards and shamans were banished forever.

Bloodsheds lasted for a few months.

But the only one Mage managed to hide from the rebels...

After a while the revolution calmed down. The new Imperator came to the throne.

And the faint, exhausted Mage finally allowed himself to go outside.
It was a big mistake...

The new King did not want to ruin his reputation
by showing that NOT all the magic was exterminated.

So guards were ordered to throw the Mage in the most secure corner
of the Cage prison to finally forget their blunder.

But they did not consider one thing...

The Mage can lose strength, greatness, and some of his abilities.
But he will never lose his honor.

Because he is the only to save the magic...
